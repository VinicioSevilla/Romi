## 4. Concepts

### Density
Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is expressed mathematically as:

```math
ρ = m / V
```

Where:
```math
ρ (rho) = density (typically in g/cm³ or kg/m³)
m = mass (in grams or kilograms)
V = volume (in cm³ or m³)
```

### Mass Measurement
Mass is measured using a balance or scale. In this lab, we use a digital balance for precise measurements.

### Volume Measurement
Volume can be measured directly for regularly shaped objects using dimensional measurements. For irregularly shaped objects, the displacement method using a graduated cylinder is employed.

### Significant Figures
Proper use of significant figures in measurements and calculations is crucial for expressing the precision of our results.

### Error Analysis
Understanding and calculating experimental errors, including percent error, helps in assessing the accuracy of our measurements and results.

## 5. Procedure
1. First, the six largest cylinders are selected from the set. The caliper is used to measure their diameter in centimeters and the ruler is then used to measure their height in centimeters. The measurements are recorded on Table 1, including the uncertainty given by the measuring tool.
2. The average diameter and average height of the cylinder set is calculated with the following equation.
$$\overline{x} = {\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\over N}$$

## 6. Conclusions

In this laboratory experiment, we have explored the fundamental concept of density through hands-on measurements and calculations. By measuring the mass and volume of various objects and subsequently calculating their densities, we have gained practical experience in applying physical principles to real-world scenarios.

Our results demonstrate the relationship between mass, volume, and density, and how these properties vary among different materials. We observed that [insert specific observations about the densities of different materials tested].

Through this experiment, we have also encountered the importance of precision in scientific measurements and the need for careful error analysis. The discrepancies between our calculated values and known densities highlight the challenges in achieving perfect accuracy in experimental settings and the importance of identifying potential sources of error.

This lab has reinforced our understanding of density as a key physical property and its relevance in material science, engineering, and everyday applications. Moving forward, we can apply this knowledge to more complex scenarios and continue to develop our skills in scientific measurement and analysis.
